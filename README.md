# GQC Agent

GQC Agent is a Python library that automates the processing of user queries using multiple AI-powered agents. It provides a structured pipeline that includes:

**Intent Classification** – Understands what the user wants to do.

**Query Rephrasing** – Refines user queries for better AI understanding.

**Note Creation** – Generates summaries or notes based on user interactions.

It supports OpenAI GPT models and Google Gemini models, runs agents in parallel threads for efficiency, and allows structured input with a full conversation history. It is designed for developers who want a simple way to integrate multi-agent AI workflows into their applications.
